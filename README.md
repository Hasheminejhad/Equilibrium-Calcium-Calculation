The pistachio irrigation and climatic needs application is an innovative and practical tool in the field of smart agriculture, designed to assist pistachio farmers in optimizing resource management and enhancing productivity using climatic data and analytical tools. This software uses scientific methodologies to estimate evapotranspiration and pistachio water requirements in 10-day intervals. It also provides data on growing degree days (GDD) and chilling days (CD) required for pistachios. This information helps farmers determine optimal timings for agricultural operations such as irrigation, fertilization, and oil application, thus preventing environmental stress.
The tool accurately calculates water requirements and adjusts irrigation amounts based on water quality, significantly reducing water consumption and improving resource management. Additionally, the app facilitates precise planning and minimizes additional costs by analyzing regional climatic data. Features such as leaching requirement calculations further enhance its utility. By promoting sustainable and smart agricultural practices, the application reduces resource use, increases profitability, and mitigates environmental impacts, contributing to ecological balance and improved pistachio farm performance. This tool not only enhances productivity but also leverages modern technology to steer agriculture toward sustainability and intelligence.
